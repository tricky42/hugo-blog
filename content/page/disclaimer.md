This is my personal blog and all thoughts, opinions  and ideas expressed here are my own. This blog does not represent the thoughts, opinions and ideas of my employer. 

It is quite likely that I will make mistakes or say something stupid (even to my standards ;)). But in the end it is human to make mistakes and I will try to prevent and correct them if necessary. And I feel pretty confident that I will be able to have a better track record than the Trump administration so far....

It might occur that over time I will change my opinions, as my blog posts are mostly point in time observations and focus on new topics I am learning about. 

Feel free to use the content published on my blog as needed and link to the original post.
