I was pretty interested in following how the teams are progressing on their journey to Dushanbe, but somehow just looking from time to time on the GPS Tracking site was not really catpuring the progress over time. 

Therfore I created two small scripts, one taking regular screenshots from the tracking website and one creating every hour a video out of the screenshots and uploading it to my website. Make sure to watch the video in fullscreen ;)
