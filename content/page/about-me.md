Not much drama, my name is Andreas Bucksteeg, I am 41 years old and live and work in beautiful Munich, Germany. 

While studying Computer Sciene at the [Technical University Munich](www.tum.de) I co-founded [hybris](https://www.hybris.com)  with friends to conquer the market of commerce solutions. What started as an adventure of a few friends continued to grow and grow and grow (ok, mayor dips and crisis included ;)). Mid 2013 hybris got aquired by [SAP](https://www.sap.com) and continued its growth. I got the chance to start working on a new solution called [YaaS](https://www.yaas.io). This is especially exciting as allowed me to learn and work with all the new tools and platforms which came up recently and which I adore. 

I honestly think that we currently experience the most exciting time since I started to work in Computer Science.  

Some examples of things I adore:

* [Unikernels](http://unikernel.org/) and especially [UniK](https://github.com/emc-advanced-dev/unik/wiki/UniK:-Build-and-Run-Unikernels-with-Ease) for making Unikernels convenient.
* [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io),
   * [Kubernetes](https://www.kubernetes.io) 
   * [Linkerd](https://linkerd.io/), it is maybe a bit early to list it under CNCF, but I just read a few days ago that work has been started to include it as a project to CNCF.
   * [OpenTacing](https://opentracing.io/) / [ZipKin](https://zipkin.io/)
   * [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)
* Golang
