My name is Andreas Bucksteeg, I am 41 years old and live and work in beautiful Munich, Germany. 

While studying Computer Science at the [Technical University Munich](www.tum.de) I co-founded with friends [hybris](https://www.hybris.com) to conquer the market of ecommerce solutions. What started as an adventure of a few friends continued to grow and grow and grow (ok, mayor dips and crisis included ;)). Mid 2013 hybris got acquired by [SAP](https://www.sap.com) and continued its growth. As a result of the growth and the continued commitment of the management to invest into new products I got the chance to start working on [YaaS](https://www.yaas.io). THe work on YaaS allowed me to learn about and work with all the new technologies, tools and projects which came up in the recent 1-2 years. It feels like Docker started a huge wave of exciting new developments and acted as an enabler for all of the goodness we see now ;)

I honestly think that we currently experience the most exciting time since I started working in Computer Science.  

Some examples of things I adore:

* [Unikernels](http://unikernel.org/) and especially [UniK](https://github.com/emc-advanced-dev/unik/wiki/UniK:-Build-and-Run-Unikernels-with-Ease) for making Unikernels easy to use and integrating them into Kubernets and Cloudfoundry.
* [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io),
   * [Kubernetes](https://www.kubernetes.io) 
   * [Linkerd](https://linkerd.io/), it is maybe a bit early to list it under CNCF, but I just read a few days ago that work has been started to include it as a project to CNCF.
   * [OpenTacing](https://opentracing.io/) / [ZipKin](https://zipkin.io/)
   * [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)
* [Golang](https://golang.org/), just started but I quiet like the Golang goal: "Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software."

Besides working in the commerce business for a software company I love traveling and driving stuff and just recently added as the perfect combination of these two a [DJI Mavic Pro](http://store.dji.com/product/mavic-pro) to the list of my gadgets.
