The answer might be yes;) In the end I just felt that in order to stay somewhat on top of all developments in the software space I had to invest quite some time after work. Talking and discussing about the things I learned to colleagues at work was fun and helped but still a lot of the knowledge got lost or didn't reach enough people. Therefore I will now try to post from time to time about the things I learn and point you to interesting articles, presentations and projects. 

It will be interesting to see how I get started during my "small" sabbatical and even more interesting if I can sustain publishing posts once reality hits and I am back at work ;) 

The blog will not be limited to software topics, I might add in my learnings about the Mavic Pro, great wines and who knows what else...

I will begin with some posts on the setup of this post, as just taking a hosted Wordpress blog didn't sound right out of different reasons. I do not like PHP (although there are impressive products built using PHP (like Wordpress)), I didn't like the resources and money needed to host my small blog using such a solutions and there for started my search for a better fitting solution more in line with my preferences. 

Cheers,

Andreas
