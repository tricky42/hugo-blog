The answer might be yes;) In the end I just felt that - in order to stay somewhat on top of all developments in the software space -I had to invest some time after work. Talking to colleagues about the things I learned was fun and helped, but a lot of information got lost or didn't reach as many people as I would have liked. So I decided to post from time to time about things I learn and use this blog to point you to articles, presentations and projects. 

It will be interesting to see how I get started during my _small_, one week sabbatical. And even more interesting, if I can continue posting once reality hits and I am back at work ;) 

The blog will not be limited to software topics, I might add my learnings about Mavic Pro, great wine and who knows what else...

I will begin with some posts on the setup of this blog. Using Wordpress didn't feel right for different reasons: 
    I do not like PHP (although there are impressive products built using PHP (like Wordpress)), I dont't like the resources and money needed to host my small blog using such a solution 

Therefore, I started my search for a solution more in line with my preferences. You can read more about it <a href='{{< relref "post/setting-up-the-blog.md" >}}'>here</a>.

Cheers,

Andreas
