The entire page is still under heavy development... 
I started this blog during my sabbatical while taking long bus rides through Laos and Cambodia. But, once I returned home, there was never enough time or I got distracted with other things. So I never brought the page to a final look that I was happy with. 

Now that I decided to use parts of the page to host the <a href='{{< relref "page/tr2017.md" >}}'>Tajik 2017 Timelapse Video</a> I just wanted you to know that it is pretty much "work in _slow_ progress" ;)

Cheers,

Andreas
